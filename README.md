# 💻 Terminal-Inspired Portfolio

A **terminal-based personal portfolio website** built during my internship at **Future Interns**.  
This project showcases my skills, projects, and developer journey through an interactive, command-line-inspired interface that blends creativity with functionality.

## 🚀 Overview

The goal of this project was to design a portfolio that feels different from traditional layouts — something that reflects how developers think and work.  
By combining a **terminal-style UI** with smooth animations and real-time data fetching, this portfolio offers both a creative and technically sound experience.
